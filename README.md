### What is CC Jewelry?

CC Jewelry is a for-fun business project that I'm hoping to start with my friend. My ultimate goal is to create a backend with Node.js and eventually incorporate everything with Shopify. I started work on the website August 2, 2020.

### Goals

My goal in creating this website was to get a better grasp on React.js, including understanding how JSX works.

Ultimately I would like to use Node.js as well as Shopify to tie everything together.
